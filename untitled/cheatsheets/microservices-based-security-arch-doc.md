# Microservices based Security Arch Doc

## Introduction[¶](microservices-based-security-arch-doc.md#introduction) <a id="introduction"></a>

The microservice architecture is being increasingly used for designing and implementing application systems in both cloud-based and on-premise infrastructures. There are many security challenges need to be addressed in the application design and implementation phases. In order to address some security challenges it is necessity to collect security-specific information on application architecture. The goal of this article is to provide a concrete proposal of approach to collect microservice-based architecture information to securing application.

## Context[¶](microservices-based-security-arch-doc.md#context) <a id="context"></a>

During securing applications based on microservices architecture, security architects/engineers usually face with the following questions \(mostly referenced in the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard Project](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS) under the section [V1 "Architecture, Design and Threat Modeling Requirements"](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x10-V1-Architecture.md#v1-architecture-design-and-threat-modeling-requirements)\):

1. Threat modeling and enforcement of the principle of least privilege:
   * What scopes or API keys does microservice minimally need to access other microservice APIs?
   * What grants does microservice minimally need to access database or message queue?
2. Data leakage analysis:
   * What storages or message queues do contain sensitive data?
   * Does microservice read/write date from/to specific database or message queue?
   * What microservices are invoked by dedicated microservice? What data is passed between microservices?
3. Attack surface analysis:
   * What microservices endpoints need to be tested during security testing?

In most cases, existing application architecture documentation is not suitable to answer those questions. Next sections propose what architecture security-specific information can be collected to answer the questions above.

## Objective[¶](microservices-based-security-arch-doc.md#objective) <a id="objective"></a>

The objectives of the cheat sheet are to explain what architecture security-specific information can be collected to answer the questions above and provide concrete proposal of approach to collect microservice-based architecture information to securing application.
